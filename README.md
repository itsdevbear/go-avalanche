# go-avalanche

***go-avalanche is a work in progress and not ready for use***

An implementation of the Avalanche consensus algorithm. It was originally transcribed from [Bitcoin ABC's](https://www.bitcoinabc.org/) C++ implementation.

The goal is to have a stable and well-tested library that can be used for expimentation, simulations, and creation of Avalanche-based consensus systems.
